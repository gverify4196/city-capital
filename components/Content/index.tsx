        Here’s what you do: Get some notebook paper or a legal pad, and a pen (or any other note application of your preference). These items will be useful to you during the entire home buying process. Once you have the ability to make notes on everything important that comes into your mind, you are ready to go.
        <br />
            <br />
Armed with your new note taking system, let’s start with determining your NEEDS and WANTS:
<br />
            <br />
NEEDS are things you absolutely require in your new home.
<br />
            <br />
WANTS are things you’d really like to have in your home, but can live without them, if necessary.
        <br />

      <div className="mb-4 py-4">
        <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold mb-4 '>Pre-purchase Planning</h2>
        <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>
        Purchasing a new manufactured, modular, or mobile home is a substantial financial investment. For many, it is the largest investment made during a lifetime. Fortunately there is a large number of financing options available as you research the best methods for purchasing your new home. But first, some education: Let’s quickly go over a few options and considerations in regards to paying for your new manufactured home...
        </p>
        
        <strong className='flex justify-start'>Option #1: Cash Purchase</strong>
        <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>Some homebuyers have ample monetary reserves and choose to pay for their new homes in full and upfront. If this is your situation – congratulations! There is little-to-no need in considering financing as a purchase option.
        <br />
        <br />
Cash purchases are generally the fastest route to homeownership.
    </p>

        <strong className='flex justify-start'>Option #2: Conventional Mortgage</strong>
        <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>With a conventional mortgage, your new home is financed and purchased as real property. This means that the home and the land are bought and/or financed together. There will be a loan application and credit approval process - usually through a bank, credit union, or independent mortgage broker. Once your loan package is finalized with your lender and your land/home combination in order, you will attend a ‘closing’ where the ownership process is finalized.
        <br />
        <br />
Remember, the conventional mortgage approach is usually taken when your new home and building site land are purchased together.
    </p>
        <strong className='flex justify-start'>Option #3: Chattel Mortgages</strong>
        <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>Chattel Mortgages are personal property loans. This method is used when only the home is financed. That is, chattel mortgages are utilized when you do not yet own your land – or – already own (or have documented possession of the land) where we will be placing the new manufactured home.
        <br />
        <br />
Unlike a conventional mortgage, you will be provided a Title instead of a Deed with Chattel Mortgages. Only when land is included in the purchase will you receive a Deed.
        <br />
        <br />
If you are buying a home that will be on leased property, a chattel mortgage may well be the only financing option available. This type of ‘leased land’ financing is common in planned communities or manufactured home parks, where the buyer doesn’t actually own the land.
    </p>

    <strong className='flex justify-start pt-2'>The Closing Costs</strong>
    <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>Chattel Mortgages are personal property loans. This method is used when only the home is financed. That is, chattel mortgages are utilized when you do not yet own your land – or – already own (or have documented possession of the land) where we will be placing the new manufactured home.
    These fees are similar across the board for all home buyers, regardless of credit history, income level, or other considerations. The really good news is that these closing costs are included in the loan amount in over 90% of our transactions. That is, you typically do not have to come up with large sums of money to pay closing costs out of pocket.
    </p>


    <strong className='flex justify-start pt-2'>The Down Payment</strong>
    <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>Whether you finance with a conventional or a chattel mortgage, you will need some form of down payment and enough funds to cover closing costs.
        <br />
        <br />
Down payments can be as low as 3.5% of the total home cost. Example: With a home price of $50,000, your down payment would be $1,750. However, an average down payment is usually about 10% of home price.

    </p>


    <strong className='flex justify-start pt-2'>Finding A Lender</strong>
    <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>Your common credit score means very little when it comes to financing a manufactured home.What is important is a FICO score (this is a very specific ranking of your credit for mortgage purposes).
<br />
<br />
If you allow one or more entities to pull your credit prior to your manufactured home purchase, you risk damaging your FICO score. Additionally, some unscrupulous re-sellers of homes will intentionally steer your credit ranking and credit application towards financial institutions they own and/or control (which can lock you into higher than market interest rates).
<br />
<br />
At Regional Homes Mobile, we work with several independent, reasonably-priced financial institutions. We actively and tirelessly seek to ensure that you get the best possible sales price on your new home as well as the smallest down payment, the lowest competitive interest rate, and most affordable monthly payments available based on your financial status and monetary position.
<br />
<br />
As part of our overall service to you, we will sit down and assess your unique financial picture. Together, we can establish the best possible loan scenario for you.

        <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold mb-4 '>𝐏𝐥𝐚𝐜𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐲𝐨𝐮𝐫 𝐡𝐨𝐦𝐞</h2>
        <strong className='flex justify-start'>So Where Do You Want To Live?</strong>
        <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>
        Finding a location for your new home is often the most fun and exciting part of homeownership–and also the most tricky. The right piece of land in the right area can truly turn your new manufactured home into your dream home!
<br />
<br />
Choosing land for your new home in a less-than-ideal location can provide on-going headaches and frustrating issues for months and years to come–so choose wisely!
<br />
<br />
When deciding where to locate your new home, you have two primary options: placing your home on land you own or intend to purchase, or leasing property on a private lot within a community or park.
        </p>
        
        <strong className='flex justify-start'>Buying Land</strong>
        <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>Owning the property underneath your home is attractive to many. Owning the land certainly makes it easier to qualify for conventional financing. Additionally, the land and home combination may appreciate in value faster than owning a home alone.

    </p>

        <strong className='flex justify-start'>Leasing Property</strong>
        <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>Leasing a site can be a less expensive option. Typically, it is also a less complicated process than buying the land outright. However, it is important to keep in mind that you own the home and not the land.

    </p>
        <strong className='flex justify-start'>Finding Land</strong>
        <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>Finding the perfect piece of land for you can often be difficult. The good news is that we have real experience helping homebuyers with this challenge. We can usually refer you to a real estate agent who is well versed in residential and rural land availability throughout our delivery radius.
<br />
<br />
As mentioned on our pre-purchase planning page, thinking through what you really want in your home site is crucial. You can limit your search and shorten the time you spend looking for land by knowing exactly what you need and want from the start.

    </p>


    <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>
    Are you prepared to develop land?
    
    <br />
Are you looking for a home site where minimal preparation will be needed?
<br />

What neighborhood amenities are important to you?

<br />
Are you interested in a planned community?
    </p>
    <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>
    Be prepared to look at a lot of properties. Buying or leasing land is a big commitment, so take your time and look for the property that really meets your needs.

    </p>


    <strong className='flex justify-start pt-2'>Developing Your Own Land</strong>

    <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>To ensure the timeliness of the home delivery process, utility hook up, and any site improvements, it is important to take some precautions to ensure long-term home site usability and durability for your new home:

    </p>
    <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>
    Zoning – Are there any regulations that would prevent placing the home on your land? A title search will probably reveal any such restrictions.
    <br /><br />
Access – Is there adequate access to the site for delivery of your home? Large trucks and heavy-duty machines are necessary right up to the set spot.
<br />
<br />
Utilities – Is there access to utilities such as electricity, gas or alternate fuel, water, sewer or septic tank?
<br /><br />
Permits – What is required in your area? More than one permit may be required for site improvement and the installation of your home.
<br /><br />
Regional Homes Mobile will provide you with all the information necessary regarding placing one of our homes in your specific area of choice.

    </p>
  

<strong className='flex justify-start pt-2'>Buying Land In A Subdivision</strong>
    <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>An increasingly popular option is purchasing a lot for your new home in a planned subdivision. These are typically attractive, well-thought-out communities. One big advantage it can offer is that much of the preparation work (including streets, lights, landscaping and utilities) has already been completed.
<br />
<br />
As with undeveloped land, consider these practical factors:
    </p>

    <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>
    Are there covenants and/or homeowner's associations?
    <br />
Ask the residents – What are their experiences with the community management?
<br />
Amenities – What is available in the community?
<br />
<br />
If purchasing land is not right for you, learn more about leasing property below.

    </p>

    <strong className='flex justify-start pt-2'>Leasing Land</strong>
    <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>Leasing can be a good option because the costs of the property are usually much lower than buying land outright. With that said, leasing may have costs over and above your rent. Ask questions and be sure to know what you’re committing to.
<br /><br />
Make sure you understand and can live with the terms of your lease. As with purchasing land, there are a number of issues to consider:

    </p>

    <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>Lease – Is there a written contract? What are the terms?
<br />
<br />
Relocation – Are there provisions in the lease to protect you if the property owner sells? Will the owner help with moving expenses?
<br />
<br />
Rules – If the property is in a community, what are the rules and regulations that tenants must abide by?
<br />
<br />
Fees – Who pays for installation costs and maintenance? What are the costs for utility connections?
<br />
<br />
Amenities – Are there golf courses, tennis courts, club houses, or other amenities that match your lifestyle?

    </p>

    <strong className='flex justify-start pt-2'>Home and Land Combined</strong>
    <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>
Simultaneously buying land along with a Regional Homes Mobile manufactured, modular or mobile home is the most common way to begin home ownership. This method is called a “land/home” transaction.
    </p>

    <strong className='flex justify-start pt-2'>This method offers you some substantial advantages:</strong>
    <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>
    Conventional financing – When real property is involved (land), a better mortgage rate may be arranged with a conventional mortgage.
<br /><br />
Equity growth – A home on the property you own can appreciate just as a site-built home does.
<br /><br />
Flexibility – You’re free to choose the land you want and position your home topographically to your best advantage.
<br /><br />
Land/home buyers can use conventional home mortgages to finance their new home purchase. As a result, they can often save thousands of dollars compared to chattel loans.
<br />
<br />
Conventional loans do require more documentation and a more detailed application process, but the money that you might save with the lower interest rates available may be worth it to you.
<br />
<br />
Our affordable financing and home site planning expert is happy to help sort through the details and options of all this with you.


    </p>

    <strong className='flex justify-start pt-2'>Planned Communities</strong>
    <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>
    
Want to live close to beaches? Want to play golf every day?
<br /><br />
Planned communities might be just what you’re looking for. These developments feature manufactured homes and often other amenities like clubhouses, planned activities and swimming pools. You purchase the home and lease the land. This allows you to stretch your budgets because you are not buying the property.
<br /><br />
Many planned communities cater to seniors and restrict the number of young people. Other communities are open to families. Most have a homeowners’ association and detailed rules that owners must follow.
<br />
<br />
If you’re interested in a planned community, consider:

Lifestyle – Does the community cater to your tastes and interests? Do you want to live in a senior-only environment? A ‘Families Only’ community?
<br /><br />
Lease – What are the terms?
<br /><br />
Rules – What are the rules and regulations and how are they enforced?
<br /><br />
Dues – What are the ongoing homeowner dues?
<br /><br />
Fees – Who pays for installation costs and maintenance? What are the costs for utility connections?
<br /><br />

If you’ve found a community you like, be sure to talk to the people that live there. How do they like the community? How are conflicts resolved? Do the owners take care of the property?

        <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>
        Now that you’ve found the perfect home and the right property, the exciting part starts – preparing the site, installing your home, and the move-in!
<br /><br />
Regional Homes Mobile will be a great resource for this project; we will be there to help at every step in the process.
<br /><br />
To start, we both need to CLEARLY understand who is performing what functions at every stage in the home site planning and home installation. We have put together a super handy Site Preparation Checklist that we can both utilizing – both as a starting point as well as a road map.
<br /><br />
If you have property in mind that you think would be good for a Regional Homes Mobile manufactured, modular or mobile home, there are some items you should consider before proceeding:
          </p>
        
      
        <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>
        Placement of the home on the property – Will the site accommodate the home size selected?
        <br /><br />
Access to the site – Homes are delivered on heavy, oversized trucks, so road access is important.
<br /><br />
Zoning, permits, development fees – Are there any regulations that would keep you from installing your home?
<br /><br />
Utility location – Is there access to gas, electricity, water, sewer? If not a public sewer, space for a septic system?
<br /><br />
Preparing the site – The land needs to be cleared, graded, and made ready to accommodate your new home.
    </p>

        <strong className='flex justify-start'>What Happens On Your Home Site</strong>
        <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>
        As your home is being built, preparation of the site will begin. A work crew will grade the site (if necessary), clear vegetation, and provide access to basic utilities. If a well or septic tank is necessary, timing must be carefully coordinated so they are available to connect to your home when it is delivered. This ensures that all utilities are available at the completion of construction and ready for the final inspection process.
    </p>
       
        <strong className='flex justify-start'>Proper Installation: The Key To A Durable, Long-Lasting Home</strong>
        <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>
        Once your home is delivered, professionally trained installation personnel need to complete the home setup, connect your utilities, and arrange for any required inspections. The correct installation of your home is critical! Here’s where working with [store name] installation professionals and/or your own experienced, independent contractors really pays off. The final steps will vary by home model and the location where the home is installed.
<br /><br />
As part of the process, coordination with third-party vendors will be scheduled to install accessories such as awnings, porches, garages, and other outbuildings.

            </p>
        <strong className='flex justify-start'>Cleaning & Move-In Preparation</strong>
        <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>
        
When the installation work is done, your home will be thoroughly cleaned, vacuumed, and dusted. Unlike a site-built home, installation typically only takes a few weeks
            </p>     

      </div>


      {/*  𝐇𝐨𝐦𝐞 𝐒𝐢𝐭𝐞 𝐏𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠....... */}

        <h2 className='text-2xl font-bold mb-4 '> 𝐌𝐨𝐯𝐞-𝐢𝐧 𝐓𝐢𝐦𝐞𝐥𝐢𝐧𝐞</h2>
        
        <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>
        
Our most frequently asked question is: “So when do we get to move in?” The short answer is: “As soon as everything in the process is completed.”
<br /><br />
The longer and more specific answer is that it generally takes 60 to 90 days to move in (sometimes shorter or sometimes longer). That is, from the time you have selected your Regional Homes Mobile manufactured, modular and mobile home, it takes 2 to 3 months for all the financing, land and home site planning, transportation and installation processes to run their course.
<br /><br />
Occasionally, a number of factors in the process do not take nearly as long as anticipated. On the short end of the timeline, we’ve had customers who have moved in within 30 days of making their purchase with us.
<br /><br />
Ultimately, our best advice is for you to allow 3 months for the entire home-buying process–then you can move in! At the same time, be open to the possibility that things may occur without typical issues or undue delays, thus allowing you to move-in before originally expected.        
      </p>
        

        <strong className='flex justify-start'>In Preparation for Move-In</strong>
        <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>
        
Not that you won’t already have plenty to do getting your new home and your land in order – but – this is a great time to simplify, clean out, and streamline your existing dwelling of clutter, junk, and ‘stuff’...
<br /><br />
Prior to moving into your new manufactured, modular or mobile home, having a garage or yard sale is encouraged. It lets you thin out your personal belongings so that you have less to physically relocate into your new home. It is also a great way to make a few extra dollars for the inevitable random expenses that occur when you move

        <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>
        
It may be hard to imagine that your new manufactured, modular and mobile home could be built in a factory, but compared to building on-site, there are some big advantages:        
        </p>
        

        
        <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>
        Controlled environment – Homes built in a factory aren’t exposed to the elements, such as: extreme weather conditions, vandalism, or theft.
<br /><br />
Time – Electrical, plumbing, and every other construction aspect is done at the factory. This eliminates the scheduling hassles that slow down site-built construction.
<br /><br />
Cost – Building a factory-crafted home produces very little waste – and, because we buy construction materials in large quantities, we can offer lower prices back to you.
<br /><br />
Quality – Each manufactured or mobile home we sell meets or exceeds the code requirements of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). And they are carefully tested and inspected.
<br /><br />
<strong>Construction Highlights</strong>
<br /><br />
Skilled craftsmen execute thousands of tasks on every manufactured, modular and mobile home we sell. Here are some highlights of the factory-construction process for many of the homes we sell:
           </p>
        <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>
        Steel cross members and outriggers are welded to massive steel I-beams to form the base frame. The underlying base frames are engineered to support the weight of the structure and meet federal building codes.
<br /><br />
Floor joists are laid over the base frame. Insulation, heat ducts, and plumbing are installed.
<br /><br />
Flooring is fastened and adhered to the floor joists.
<br /><br />
While the frame is constructed, the walls are built.
<br /><br />
Once the walls are installed, truss rafters are attached and high-grade insulation is put in.
<br /><br />
Roof sheathing and roofing paper are installed. This is sealed with tar three feet from the edge for extra protection. The roof is then shingled. This process varies by home type.
<br /><br />
All interior finish work is done, including installation of custom cabinetry from our industry-leading cabinet shops.
<br /><br />
Siding is mounted and windows are set.
<br /><br />
Multi-section homes are checked to ensure seams and patterns match, a final inspection is conducted, and the home is prepared for transportation

If you haven’t already, you should read the two preceding portions of the Homebuyer’s Guide entitled “The Buying Process” and “The Construction Process” before embarking into this section. Doing so will make this part of the guide much more understandable.
<br /><br />
If you have made it this far into the manufactured, modular and mobile home buying process, all the want and needs, the decision making, planning, shopping, financing, home site preparations, deliveries, installations, and everything else that has transpired are complete. The last of the construction, installation and utility services are either finished or soon will be.
<br /><br />
This means you will be moving into your new Regional Homes Mobile home very soon – Congratulations!
<br /><br />
Before you officially move-in, there will be one last walk through and a Final Inspection. Once everyone agrees all things are in order with your new home, you’ll be officially ready to start moving in.
<br /><br />
In this section, we will go over a few seemingly small, yet very important, topics you should be aware of as you take ownership and begin residence in your new manufactured, modular or mobile home. These include:

        </p>    

        <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>
The Final Inspection
<br /><br />
Your Home Warranty
<br /><br />
Your Insurance
<br /><br />
Your Property Taxes
<br /><br />
Referrals
<br /><br />
Once you have these remaining areas of responsibility and clerical work complete, you can finally relax, get moved in and start fully enjoying your new residence!

        Like anything you purchase, you expect a warranty backing up the product’s materials, workmanship, and overall quality/durability. It is no different from a manufactured home.
<br /><br />
Regional Homes Mobile will be issuing you a full, one-year manufacturer’s home warranty upon completion of the overall purchase and your moving into the new residence.
<br /><br />
When you invest in a manufactured, modular or mobile home from us, you can be sure you’re getting a home that has been built with quality materials by expert craftsmen. If any issue with materials, workmanship, or our installation arises, you will have the backing of one of the best warranties in the entire manufactured home industry.
<br /><br />
The structural components of your home are covered for any defects in material and workmanship for one year after the date of your purchase.
<br /><br />
Should you ever need to use your warranty, we will be happy to help you resolve your service needs within the warranty dates.
<br /><br />
Our warranty means buying a Regional Homes Mobile home is not only a sound decision; it’s one backed with competency, security, and quality.
<br /><br />
Important Note: If you make any agreements or written deals with independent contractors during the planning, preparation, and/or installation of the project, you will need to inquire and obtain their warranty and guarantee policies separately. We cannot be responsible for the work of others who are not under our direct instruction and control.
Extended Home Warranty
Another great benefit we offer when you purchase a home with us is the option to purchase an additional Extended Home Warranty. Many of our home buyers prefer the security of having extended warranties on their new manufactured, modular or mobile home.
<br /><br />
An extended home warranty is a service contract that covers the repair or replacement of many of the most frequently occurring breakdowns of home system components and appliances. It covers various parts of your home beyond the standard one-year warranty.
<br /><br />
As the years and months pass, unexpected repair or replacement costs can potentially occur. An extended home warranty cannot prevent systems or appliances from breaking down, but it can help make handling covered repairs or replacements easier and less costly.

        you are financing any portion of your new manufactured, modular or mobile home, your lender will require you to have and maintain Homeowners Insurance as part of the loan agreement.
<br /><br />
If you didn’t know, Home Owners Insurance is pretty straightforward: It provides financial protection against disasters. A standard policy insures the home itself and the things you keep in it.
<br /><br />
Homeowners insurance is typically a package policy. That is, the policy covers both damage to your property and your liability or legal responsibility for any injuries and property damage you or members of your family cause to other people. This often includes damage caused by household pets.
<br /><br />
Damage caused by most disasters is covered, but there are exceptions. Examples of exceptions are those damages caused by floods, earthquakes, and poor maintenance. In most cases, you will need to obtain flood and/or earthquake insurance as separate, standalone policies, if you seek that sort of protection.
<br /><br />
    <i>
    Please note: Common household and property maintenance-related problems are always the homeowners’ responsibility and are not covered by your Homeowners Insurance policy.
So how do you get homeowners insurance?
Homeowners Insurance is fairly easy to obtain. It is similar to getting insurance for your motor vehicle. If you have an established relationship with an independent insurance agent, we suggest speaking with them first. They will almost certainly be able to rapidly and affordably assist you. If you do not have an agent, we have a number of readily available insurance companies that specialize in modular, manufactured, and mobile home policies. Our staff can help you find and secure the best policy and rates available for your unique situation.

After you get all moved in, settled, and back into a normal routine, we’d be extremely grateful and appreciative if you shared your buying experience.

All you have to do is point them in our direction and instruct them to tell us that you referred them, and we’ll take care of the rest. Thank you!

The journey to your dream home is almost complete. All that is left is the Final Inspection! Actually, it is up to three (3) Final Inspections: Yours, Ours, and the City/County.
<br /><br />
Your Inspection
Once you have closed on the funding/financing of your new manufactured, modular or mobile home, it’s time for your final inspection. This is your opportunity to make sure that everything is as you expect it to be.
<br /><br />
Get organized and use a checklist so you cover everything.

                  </ul>
        Making your final inspection in an organized way is a good strategy. We suggest inspecting the outside of your home first, and then check the interior, carefully going through each room.

       <strong className='flex justify-start'>Our Inspection</strong>
        <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>
        
        Regional Homes Mobile will do a similar walkthrough and final inspection. It will be more thorough, rigorous and extensive than may think. Our goal is to ensure your new manufactured, modular or mobile home is 100% up to our high standards. We want your new residence to be exactly as we promised it would be with ALL components in place and everything working as expected.

        </p>

       <strong className='flex justify-start'>City and/or County Inspection</strong>
        <p className='py-2 text-left text-gray-900'>
            
Every city, town and county in our area has various building and construction codes. Some jurisdictions will require a permit and inspections, others will not. Once we know the exact physical address of your property, we can advise you on what final inspections, if any, are required by the local municipality and/or county.
